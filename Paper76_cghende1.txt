  I understand that three pages is a very small amount of space for such a large
  topic - I struggled with this as well. The paper is making a point of touching
  on almost of all of the topics that Agile has to offer, which is just not possible
  in a mere three pages. The result is that a large portion of the paper is
  bullet points and lists of all of the topics that comprise Agile with very little
  context or explanation. Since we have such a small amount of space available to us, I would
  suggest distilling Agile into a small handful of quintessential topics (perhaps
  iteration and one or two others?) and drilling deeper down into those topics.

  To put it into programmer parlance, try out a depth-first-search instead of a
  breadth-first-search! In a DFS you get to select a few of the most important
  aspects and drill down into them completely. In a BFS, by the time you've
  enumerated the first level of the graph, the paper is over!

  Of course, continue to work on your English. It did not bother me greatly as
  most of the ideas were still successfully conveyed. However, people in the
  future will probably be jerks about it. They could be native speakers taking
  cheap shots or they could be individuals who had to learn English as well
  and now demand that you "suffer just a much as they did". I know
  that the language is hard, keep it up!
