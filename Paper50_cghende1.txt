  Well done! You conveyed quite a few of the ideals of Agile in such a short paper.

  For future revisions I would like to see better organization of thoughts as well
  as some English improvements. I am empathetic towards non-native speakers, and
  I generally do not let imperfections bother me, however there were moments in
  the paper where I was actually confused before I finally understood the intention.
  For example, in the second paragraph of the introduction:

  "Today a lot of predictable and repeatable jobs are done much faster often
  by machines, things change more quickly."

  This one sentence is actually harboring two independent thoughts:
    1. That automation is rapidly increasing in the world.
    2. That the technological landscape is rapidly changing as well.

  Indeed, flowing from one thought to the next is one of the greater challenges
  when doing any sort of written word. This is doubly so if English is not your first
  language. If you improve the flow of your ideas on paper (from sentence to sentence,
  from paragraph to paragraph) then your understanding of the topic will more readily
  flow out as well.
